Our project idea is to implement a version of the classic arcade game "Space Invaders" using what we have learned in class. Some goals for our project are as follows:

Milestone 1:
Must
[X] Player with ability to move back and forth and shoot at aliens
[X] Aliens that move back and forth automatically and shoot at player

Should
[X] Enemy animations for movement

Could
[] Boss enemy

Milestone 2:
Must
[X] Cover for player to hide behind that breaks as it's shot by enemies
[X] Multiple Levels

Should
[] Different alien types, some with more health, some with different weapons
[X] Power-ups for the player to grab, like health-refill or movement speed increase (maybe other weapons too?)

Could
[] More complex enemy movement

Won't
- Multiplayer functionality
- Randomly generated levels
